# Computer Architecture Multiple Choice Questions
## Memory Hierarchy and Virtualization

This document contains 40 multiple-choice questions focused on computer architecture concepts related to memory hierarchy and virtualization from Chapter 5 ("Large and Fast: Exploiting Memory Hierarchy") of the Computer Organization and Design textbook, 5th Edition.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Virtual Machines
- Fundamentals of virtualization technology
- Advantages and performance implications
- Historical context (IBM VM/370) and modern implementations (VMware)
- Hardware resource sharing and management
- Hardware-assisted virtualization

### 2. Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)
- Role in mapping virtual to physical resources
- Handling privileged instructions
- Resource access management
- Guest and host OS interactions

### 3. Timer Virtualization
- Managing timer interrupts in virtualized environments
- Preventing time drift in guest operating systems
- VMM's role in timer management

### 4. Instruction Set Support
- User mode vs. system mode execution
- Privileged instruction handling
- Trap mechanisms
- Modern processor architecture adaptations for virtualization

### 5. Virtual Memory
- Extending RAM using disk storage
- Page concepts and page sizes
- Page fault handling
- Address translation mechanisms
- Memory Management Unit (MMU) functionality

### 6. Page Tables
- Virtual-to-physical address mapping
- Page Table Entry (PTE) structure
- Status bits (dirty, reference/use)
- Page replacement algorithms (LRU)

### 7. Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)
- Accelerating address translation
- TLB hit/miss handling
- Hardware vs. software TLB management
- Performance implications

### 8. Cache Coherence
- Maintaining consistent memory views in multi-processor systems
- Coherence protocols (snooping, directory-based)
- Write policies (write-through, write-back)
- Invalidation mechanisms
- Memory consistency models

## Question Format

Each question includes:
- A clearly stated problem or concept
- Four possible answer choices
- One correct answer

## Usage

These MCQs are suitable for:
- Course examinations
